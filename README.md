# React Native App Template
The repository provides a template for quickly creating a new react native app. The easiest way to implement is to import the respository.

## Installing

## Dependencies / Packages
### React Native 
### React Elements
### React Navigation 5.x
React Navigation changes how to configure and setup navigation in the app from the 4x versions. I've tried to create a template that leverages how to best design a UI with the new library. The new library uses __Dynamic__ routes, so you can only switch between __Navigation Stacks__ when they are wrapped in the BottomTabNavigation unlike before when I could wrap the whole app in the __appContainer__.
